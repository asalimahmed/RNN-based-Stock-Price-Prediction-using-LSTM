## Project Description
### About

### Experimentations
#### Experiment-1 (60 days, 10 epochs)
- The first experiment was run for **10 epochs** and learned over past **60 days** of data to analyze how the model will perform on the data and what could be the kind of predictions we can expect from the low epoch values. 
- Below is the screenshot of the real vs the predicted regression for the test dataset.</br>

#### Experiment-2 (60 days, 25 epochs)
- The first experiment was run for **25 epochs** and learned over past **60 days** of data to analyze how the model will perform on the data and what could be the kind of predictions we can expect from the low epoch values. 
- Below is the screenshot of the real vs the predicted regression for the test dataset.</br>

#### Experiment-3 (60 days, 35 epochs, increasing Droupouts)
- The first experiment was run for **35 epochs** and learned over past **60 days** and also increasing the droupouts to be **0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20** for each layer respectively of data to analyze how the model will perform on the data and what could be the kind of predictions we can expect from the low epoch values.

#### Experiment-4 (60 days, 50 epochs)
- The first experiment was run for **50 epochs** and learned over past **60 days** of data to analyze how the model will perform on the data and what could be the kind of predictions we can expect from the low epoch values. 
- Below is the screenshot of the real vs the predicted regression for the test dataset.</br>

#### Experiment-6 (120 days, 100 epochs)
- The first experiment was run for **100 epochs** and learned over past **120 days** of data to analyze how the model will perform on the data and what could be the kind of predictions we can expect from the low epoch values. 
- Below is the screenshot of the real vs the predicted regression for the test dataset.</br>

## Analysis and Accuracy
- I have achieved an overall loss of around **(~0.15%)** which is 0.0015 validation loss over 120 days past data training running for 100 epochs, calculated as Root mean squared error calculation.
- Future Scope: The loss can still be optimized based on the **Hyper Parameter Tuning** to fit the model much better over the testing data.
